Check that the output matches the variables show in the script.\r\n\r\nTo test a simple AMF gateway: configure and run the HTTP server in examples/http-server, then configure and run the Flash client in example/http-client.\r\n\r\nAlso in this project is some experimental work implementing RTMP. This should probably be split into its own project.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n* The AMF library is largely complete and working, but not thoroughly tested.\r\n* The RTMP work is experimental and not ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nNodeJS has a habit of changing and depreciating function names. \r\nIf you get missing function errors, then you need to upgrade NodeJS.\r\nSee http://github.com/timwhitlock/node-amf/commit/62a85b8531307c86ff27daa21e48012a7558552a\r\n\r\nAMF0 is only partially supported, due to it being depreciated. AMF3 should be used by all clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-amf is dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses, See LICENSE.\r\n",
